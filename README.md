# Web-Scraper-Decoder-Challenge
This was a coding challenge that was given out, but I thought this was pretty cool so I thought it would be cool do display my work. Basically using the beautifulsoup library, it scrapes data from the website which has a table of coordinates and a specific unique Unicode character that is to be placed on a grid. Using Numpy I created a grid using an array and placed coordinates based on what is given. And then this will display a message of the secret message in the terminal.

## Libraries used
beautifulsoup4
numpy
requests

To install these libraries just do pip install <lib name>
